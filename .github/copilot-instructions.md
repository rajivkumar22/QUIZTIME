# AI Quiz Generator Platform - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a React.js application that generates interactive quizzes using AI. The app allows users to input any topic and receive a customized multiple-choice quiz generated by OpenAI's API.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components with React hooks only (no class components)
- Use JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- Use styled-components for styling
- Follow responsive design principles
- Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Use modern ES6+ syntax

## Key Features
- AI-powered quiz generation using OpenAI API
- Responsive design with animations
- Progressive quiz-taking experience
- Detailed results with explanations
- Fallback to sample questions when API is unavailable

## Component Structure
- `App.jsx` - Main application component with state management
- `Home.jsx` - Landing page with topic input and quiz configuration
- `Quiz.jsx` - Interactive quiz component with progress tracking
- `Results.jsx` - Results page with score display and detailed feedback

## Styling Approach
- Use styled-components for component-specific styles
- Implement gradient backgrounds and glass-morphism effects
- Include subtle animations and hover effects
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Use consistent color palette based on blues and purples

## API Integration
- Integrate with OpenAI ChatGPT API for quiz generation
- Handle API errors gracefully with fallback content
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement loading states during API calls

When suggesting code improvements or new features, ensure they align with the existing architecture and design patterns.
